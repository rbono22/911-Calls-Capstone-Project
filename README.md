# 911-Calls-Capstone-Project

For this capstone project I analyzed 911 call data from a Kaggle data set leveraging the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. I found that the zip code 19401 had the most 911 calls with 6979 reported calls, while Lower Merion had the highest 911 calls of all townships with 8443 calls. Furthermore I created visualizations to understand the reasons/departments for a 911 call, and the most popular days of the week and months of the year with average 911 calls. Below are my results.

### Calls by Department

I ran a few simple lambda function to create a new column splitting the title of the reason. In doing so, I found that the three reasons for 911 calls were to contact EMS (48877 calls), the Traffic department (35695 calls), and the Fire department (14920 calls).

### Average Calls by Day of the Week

Through this bar chart I observed that EMS 911 calls occur on average the most on Fridays with around 7,500 calls, and on average the least on Sundays with around 6,500 calls. Similarly traffic 911 calls occur on average the least on Sundays with around 3,500 calls, but on average the most 911 calls fall on Tuesday with around 6900 calls. However fire 911 calls are on average around the same number of calls regardless of the day of the week, hovering around 2100 calls per day of the week.

### Average Calls by Month of the Year

Observation about how there must have been a really bad car crash in February.
