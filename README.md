# 911-Calls-Capstone-Project

For this capstone project I analyzed 911 call data from a Kaggle data set leveraging the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. I found that the zip code 19401 had the most 911 calls with 6979 reported calls, while Lower Merion had the highest 911 calls of all townships with 8443 calls. To understand the reasons/departments for a 911 call, I ran a simple lambda function to create a new column splitting the title of the reason. In doing so, I found that the three reasons for 911 calls were to contact EMS (48877 calls), the Traffic department (35695 calls), and the Fire department (14920 calls). Below is a seaborn countplot generated to visualize the results:

Additionally I created a timeStamp column to determine which days of the week and months had the most 911 calls by department. Below is a breakdown of my results:
